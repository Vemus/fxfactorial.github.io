I'm a computer programmer in San Francisco, CA with a preference for
functional programming, I'm lucky enough that I write OCaml everyday.

* Open Source Projects Worth Mentioning
These are all up on github and licensed with BSD-3.
1) OCaml bindings library for [[https://www.maxmind.com/en/home][geoip2]], provides geolocation information
   from a given IP address. Pretty stable.
2) OCaml bindings library for [[https://www.libssh.org/][libssh]], provides implementation of the
   ssh protocol. This is not stable, I need to work on it.
