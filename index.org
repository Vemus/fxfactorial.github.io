I'm a computer programmer in San Francisco, CA with a preference for
functional programming, specifically [[https://ocaml.org/][OCaml]]. My undergraduate is in
Philosophy and I did some graduate computer science coursework in New
York City.

* Open Source Projects Worth Mentioning
These are all up on github and licensed with BSD-3.
1) OCaml bindings library for [[https://www.maxmind.com/en/home][geoip2]], provides geolocation information
   from a given IP address. Pretty stable.
2) OCaml bindings library for [[https://www.libssh.org/][libssh]], provides implementation of the
   ssh protocol. This is not stable, I need to work on it.
3) ~Objective-C/C/OCaml~ powered native Cocoa application for ~OS X~,
   its a GUI for ssh sessions, uses libssh, its called [[https://github.com/fxfactorial/tallgeese][Tallgeese]]
4) A [[https://github.com/fxfactorial/podge][Hodgepodge]] of functions for OCaml, really a prototyping library,
   ideal for hackathons.
