  <h1>Simpler Blogging</h1>
  <p>
Blogging is usually a pleasurable experience, it's a good way to know
whether you know whatever it is you actually claim to know. Previously
I was using <a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a> paired with <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> and it was fairly
decent although the emacs configuration was painful at times.
</p>

<p>
The real problem was building the site and deploying. Octopress is a
Ruby application since octopress is built on top of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and that's
a Ruby program. I blindly and admittedly stupidly did:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell">$ gem update
</pre>
</div>
<p>
which of course broke my project. Add to that I fiddled with the
Rakefile which utterly broke the project. Yes I could have fixed all
the problems, eventually that is. But that would have taken much time
and even worse I'd be learning how the sausage is made for a project
that I don't really care about. Where's the abstraction then? I always
like using technologies and languages that I already know, of
course. So naturally I wanted an emacs based solution and emacs offers
a great mode called org-mode. I looked at <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html">this</a> and tried most of the
listed libraries/packages/frameworks. Unfortunately the vast majority
were either abandoned or broken but I did finally find <a href="https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page">org-page</a> and
I'm using that now. I like it because its lightweight, based on
org-mode and has a simple publishing model, no crazy Rakefiles, no
build systems. I'll be porting over my previous three blog posts over
here as well and I expect to write on topics more than just
programming/coding. As always feel free to leave comments and
questions.
