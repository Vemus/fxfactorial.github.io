#+DESCRIPTION: Config emacs for kernel hacking

*Note* This post initially appeared on my previous blog and I'm just
 porting it over to here with small stylistic changes. 

This post will share some configurations I did to setup emacs for
linux kernel coding. Some minor context, the following emacs setup
came as a result of my Operating Systems class fall 2014. Note, a lot
of what I will go over is due to the great tutorials and walkthroughs
made by the emacs community, especially by Tuhdo's [[http://tuhdo.github.io/c-ide.html][great post]].

* The tools
Since our homeworks were assigned on a Debian VM, the natural
beginning tool was emacs+tramp. One thing early annoyance was tramp
constantly asking for passwords, so I put this in my init.el
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq password-cache-expiry nil)
#+END_SRC
